Morse Coded is a project that seeks to offer its user a number of different ways to interact with
morse code. Depending on how the program is used, the user is be able to exchange messages to and
from the program in various ways: normal characters (ex. TEXT); marks and spaces (ex. - . .-.. -);
and pressing a button to form pulses. These forms of interaction will allow the user to play some
morse code based games and to use a morse code translator. The program will also allow the user to
create an account and log in, or to just play as a guest. The program will keep track of various
user data in separate files; for the purposes of this project, these files will just be stored
locally. The user will be able to access their own user account data for the morse code games,
even when the program is closed and reopened.

To run the program, run morseCoded.py.

The program comes with an account that's already been made. Here's the login info:
